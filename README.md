# Introduction to Python Programming and Data Science Bootcamp

These materials are a part of the Introduction to Python Programming and Data Science Bootcamp that
is run at Northwestern University. To date this Bootcamp has been an intensive, five day bootcamp
aimed at beginners and has been graciously sponsored by Northwestern University as a part of its Big
Data Initiative.

#Software Installation

There is a basic core that is necessary to install in order to interactively use these course
materials (which is how this bootcamp should be done). The two main requirements are:

* Anaconda Python 3.4
* PyCharm

We use the Anaconda Python distribution because of its ease of installation and PyCharm for the
development of scripts (in-class instruction only). Currently we have installation videos for both
Mac OS X (OS X 10.10 version) and Microsoft Windows (Windows 8). These can be found on-line at:

* OS X <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQhOyZXHkxI>
* Windows <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w16iUU6IA5E>

While those exact operating system versions are not necessary, the installation on your personal
computer will differ from the videos if it is not the same. If you do not have a machine with **at
least** Windows 7 or OS X 10.8 we suggest that you use a different machine, since several of the
modules will run very slowly on your hardware.

#Usage of Course Materials

This text and the majority of the course will conducted with IPython Notebook
<http://ipython.org/notebook.html>. IPython Notebook is a 'web-based interactive computational
environment', meaning that it allows to write and execute python code in a web page from our own
computers. The IPython Notebook is a relatively new tool and we believe that is an excellent way to
teach the basics of python programming and computational data analysis.

IPython Notebook is installed by default with the Anaconda Python distribution so
everyone that has followed the installation instructions will have it. A basic demonstration of how
to start IPython Notebook server and use it is here <need.video.com>
