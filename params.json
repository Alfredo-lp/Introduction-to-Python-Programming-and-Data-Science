{"name":"Introduction to Python Programming and Data Science","tagline":"Northwestern 2015 Bootcamp (Aug. 8-11, 14-16)","body":"### Welcome to the Bootcamp\r\nThis bootcamp is designed for Northwestern students who have little to none previous experience with programming. Through interactive instruction and project-based work we plan to teach you the basics of programming python and data analysis.\r\n\r\n###Requirements\r\n**You must have a current laptop with Windows or OS X.**\r\nIf it is a Windows laptop then it should have Windows 7, 8, or 8.1 ([installation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w16iUU6IA5E))\r\nIf it is a Mac then it should have OS X 10.9 or 10.10 ([installation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQhOyZXHkxI))\r\n\r\n###Expectations\r\nWe expect that students will attend all days of the bootcamp and complete the assigned homeworks each day. If you must miss a day of the bootcamp, we expect that you will tell us in advance. Also, you must achieve a high-passing score on that day's homework to remain in the bootcamp. \r\n\r\nAt the end of this bootcamp you should be able/learned to:\r\n* Write basic Python programs\r\n* Perform data analysis in Python (plotting, averages, etc.)\r\n* Basic image analysis\r\n* Scrape web pages\r\n* Basic textual analysis\r\n* Basic structured data analysis\r\n\r\nThis course is intended as an introduction and to teach you basic programming and data analysis skills. Our goal is for you to acquire a breadth of experience and learn to think programmatically so that you can perform analyses on big data sets on your own/in the future. We are specifically **not** covering current Big Data technologies.\r\n\r\n###Syllabus\r\n**Day 1.**\r\nSimple and complex data types, Flow Control\r\n\r\n**Day 2.**\r\nFilesystem, File I/O, Functions\r\n\r\n**Day 3.**\r\nImports, Standard Library, Plotting, Review\r\n\r\n**Day 4.**\r\nPython Mini-Project, Image Analysis with Numpy\r\n\r\n**Day 5.** \r\nScraping the Web\r\n\r\n**Day 6.**\r\nRegular Expressions, Textual Analysis\r\n\r\n**Day 7.**\r\nStructured Data Analysis with Pandas","google":"UA-10517807-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
