<p>
Homeworks will be assigned every day and will cover all concepts that we have discussed in the bootcamp up to that point.
We anticipate that each homework will take approximately 1.5 hours to complete.
</p>

<p>
All homeworks must be turned in before the next day of the bootcamp starts (Bootcamp starts at 9 am).
No late assignments will be accepted for grading.
</p>

<p>
We will be grading the homeworks algorithmically, so no partial credit will be assigned and we will not revise/review any grades assigned (Unless there's a bug in our code and everyone gets it wrong. That could happen and it will be minorly embarrassing).
</p>

<p>
Students who achieve a High Passing grade will be awarded a certificate (Note: no physicial certificates will be presented. It's a theoretical/virtual certificate) at the end of the course in recognition of their work and to demonstrate their skill.

<ul>
    <li> <strong>Step 1:</strong> save your work by clicking on the floppy icon
    <img src = 'images/save_homework.png'></img></li>
    <li> <strong>Step 2:</strong> Restart the kernel. This makes sure that only things <strong>currently</strong> typed are running.
    <img src = 'images/kernel_restart.png'></img></li>
    <li> <strong> Step 3:</strong> Run all of the homework cells. If there are <strong>ANY</strong> errors fix them. Errors could cause a problem in the grading software which would result in a poor overall homework grade for you (remember there isn't partial credit, so an answer that won't run is worth nothing).
    <img src = 'images/run_all_cells.png'></img></li>
    <li> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Rename the homework
    <img src = 'images/hw-rename.png'></img></li>
    <li> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Upload to canvas</li>
    <li> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Relax! You earned it.</li>
