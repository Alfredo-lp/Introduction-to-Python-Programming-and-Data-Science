    "\n",
    "Whether it's extracting numerical data from text, or dealing with text directly, the ability to manipulate text in the form of strings is essential for any number of data science projects. More importantly, analyzing text allows for quantitative analysis in a number of areas that would be prohibitive otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, think about a meeting transcript (for example, consider the meeting minutes of the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm)). Typical qualitative analysis would require someone to read the transcript and then summarize and infer what the main points and viewpoints of the participants were. This is an extremely important and thorough way to examine historical documents and generate insight. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if you were interested in understanding how the Fed's viewpoint on monetary policy has evolved in the last 50 years? What if you were interested in understanding which topics the Fed considered most important at different points in that same time period? Our qualitative analysis, which can be seen as a gold standard, starts to fall apart in this context because of the sheer amount of work that would be required to accomplish the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a qualitative longitudinal analysis is certainly possible, you are pretty much describing 5-7 years of intensive research. Many times you simply **do not** have this amount of time and energy available. \n",

    "As an adult human, you feel an innate understanding of language and text. However, the understanding you currently have is not innate, it is the byproduct of 18+ years of learning. The computer simply **does not have 18+ years of understanding human language to fall back on**. Further, programming code to perform tasks that you innately do is one of the hardest things to accomplish, because you are frequently unaware of how many assumptions rely on and exceptions you make to understand text as a whole. In general, implicit judgments are some of the hardest to remember to put into code.\n",
