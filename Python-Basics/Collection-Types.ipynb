    "\n",
    "When we create a variable in a language it has some `value` associated with it. That `value` goes into the memory of our computer and the language stores the information that when I use my `variable`, that the `variable` is linked to a certain `value` in the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when I set `second_variable` equal to `variable` the computer thinks:\n",
    "\n",
    "`A-ha! I am a smart computer, this second_variable just needs to be linked to the same value at the same place in memory. That is very easy, I'll just remember that second_variable goes to value`\n",
    "\n",
    "So now when we change `second_variable` we also change the value for `variable`, since they are sharing the same `value` in the computer's memory. This might seem silly, but way back when memory was an extremely precious resource in computers so languages would try to minimize using it and relied on you, the programmer, to be both careful and explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we want to copy a variable's contents from one variable to another, placing an identical but separate `value` in memory we have to use the `copy()` function. Every distribution of Python comes with `copy()`, but we have to import it from the library to use it."
