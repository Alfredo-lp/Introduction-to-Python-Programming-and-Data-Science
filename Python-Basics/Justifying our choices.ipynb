    "If you're a sociologist, big data happens when you want to analyze 1,000,000 survey responses instead of 1000. If you are a biologist, it happens when Excel crashes analyzing time course data from microfluidics. If you are an historian, it happens when you want to analyze 100 sources instead of 10.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Python is dynamic, when you need a new value you can just create it\n",
    "2. Python is readable, code is more often read than written!\n",
    "3. Python has strong typing, this means that it won't add the number 2 and the word two together\n",
