    "Of all the reasons to use Python, number one  (by a landslide) is that the community of Python programmers provide a ton of support. Most problems that you will encounter have been solved by someone, it's just a matter of knowing how to find and interpret the solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare to become intricately familiar with [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.org) which is a messageboard where people post a dizzying array of problems and solutions that are ranked by the community in terms of their helpfulness. And if you're not already proficient at articulating the precise nature of your problem with google, prepare to learn. Google can either be your [best friend](https://www.google.com/#q=python+divide+string+into+list+of+characters), or a [mortal foe](https://www.google.com/#q=how+do+i+get+numbers+and+letters+as+a+list+in+python).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some problems, however, are so general that they just keep ocurring again and again and again. The community of Python programmers have taken some of these problems, figured out fast and efficient solutions to them, and provided the code directly to you in the form of a \"library\". Not all libraries come with the \"default\" Python because there are just too many of them. You can and likely will write your own libraries for specific problems you encounter. But some libraries are _really_ useful. The reason you all downloaded the punily named \"Anaconda\" is because it's Python, only _bigger_. Instead of just giving you Python, Anaconda has collected a range of other common \"libraries\" that nearly every Python programmer uses and has installed these for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Default\" Python, however still has a lot of useful libraries known as the \"Standard Library\". A key principle here is _trust_, the things you find in the Python Standard Library will work. And they will work well. __When you find an answer to a question on stackoverflow, your confidence in that answer should be tempered and the results tested.__ If it's in the Python Standard Library, thousands of people have already tested it and it works. The same goes for some other very common packages, such as those included in Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on, we should note that this notebook has drawn heavily from the following references which are each great in their own right at helping to explain details of the Standard Library and Python programming in general.
