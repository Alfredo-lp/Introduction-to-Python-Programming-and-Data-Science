    "### #3: Convert pickles to JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Serialization**][wpserial] is the act of converting *structured* data in memory into a simple, (serial) sequence of bytes. The sequence can be given to arbitrary data handling software and hardware to store (i.e. to a file) or send (across the internet) that doesn't need to know anything about the logical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has two good standard libraries for serialization: `pickle` (Python-specific) and `json` (a cross-language format originally developed for JavaScript). Each has its advantages, but the major difference is that `pickle` is more complex, allowing it to easily serialize some objects that `json` can't, while because of its simplicity, `json` is safer, and widely supported by other programming languages. If the JSON format works for your application, try to use it. Out-of-the-box JSON will support dictionaries, lists, tuples (they're treated like lists), integers, floats, strings, booleans, and `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, in this scenario we have a bunch of pickle files (`*.pkl`) in a directory. We need to convert them into JSON files so we can send them to a collaborator that might be using C#, JavaScript, or MATLAB. **Write a function** that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* is named `convert_pickles_to_json` \n",
    "* takes a single argument: the path of the directory where the pickle files are (they end in `*.pkl`). \n",
    "* deserializes the pickle, then reserializes it as a JSON file with the `pkl` extension replaced by `json` (e.g. `gherkins_are_good.pkl` &rarr; `gherkins_are_good.json`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example pickles are provided in `Data/Pickles`, along with a text file that you shouldn't touch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: use the following functions (Google them to find documentation or examples using them):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `glob.iglob`\n",
    "* `json.dump`\n",
    "* `pickle.load`\n",
