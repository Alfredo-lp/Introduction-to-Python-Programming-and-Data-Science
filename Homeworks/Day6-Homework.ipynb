    "\n",
    "Along with everyone else, you have a shot at winning the Republican primary. You anticipate an implosion of the Trump campaign, and have preemptively set your sights on Jeb Bush. Your smear tactics include a plan to convince Jeb's friends and colleagues to publicly denounce him. To this end, you plan to spam everyone Jeb knows in the hope that a handful of disgruntled individuals will come forward with details of Jeb's past indiscretions. As you only wish to turn Jeb's closest and longest-standing allies, you turn to an old dataset in order to identify his contacts: Jeb's published email history from 2001. In this assignment you will search through all of Jeb's emails in order to identify and spam as many of his friends as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "The homework has three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Part 1: Use regular expressions to determine what does or does not qualify as a valid email address.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Part 2: Apply these expressions to Jeb's emails in order to identify all of his contacts.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Part 3: Identify the individual that has received the most emails from Jeb."

    "\n",
    "First, we want to find a way to distinguish email addresses from other strings. For example, 'jeb@jeb.org' is a valid email address, while 'jeb' is not. Your task is to write a function that receives a string and returns True if the string is a valid email address or False if the string is not a valid address.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules defining valid email addresses are extremely complicated, but they generally consist of a local part and a domain part connected by an '@' symbol. In Hillary Clinton's email address (hdr22@clintonemail.com), `hdr22` is the local part while `clintonemail.com` is the domain. Both the local and domain parts must begin and end with alphanumeric characters, but they may contain both '.' and '-' characters within them. The `.com` part is known as the top-level domain, and this must be present in some form, such as `.com`, `.edu`, `.co.uk`, `.gov`, etc.. See the examples below for further clarification:\n",
