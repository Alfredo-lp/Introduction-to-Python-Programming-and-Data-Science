    "\n",
    "Along with everyone else, you have a shot at winning the Republican primary. You anticipate an implosion of the Trump campaign, and have preemptively set your sights on Jeb Bush. Your smear tactics include a plan to convince Jeb's friends and colleagues to publicly denounce him. To this end, you plan to spam everyone Jeb knows in the hope that a handful of disgruntled individuals will come forward with details of Jeb's past indiscretions. As you only wish to turn Jeb's closest and longest-standing allies, you turn to an old dataset in order to identify his contacts: Jeb's published email history from 2001. In this assignment you will search through all of Jeb's emails in order to identify and spam as many of his friends as possible. \n",

    "*Part 1: Use regular expressions to determine what does or does not qualify as a valid email address.*\n",

    "*Part 2: Apply these expressions to Jeb's emails in order to identify all of his contacts.*"

    "First, we want to find a way to distinguish email addresses from other strings. For example, 'jeb@jeb.org' is a valid email address, while 'jeb' is not. Email addresses may contain additional '.' or '-' characters, though generally start and end with alphanumeric characters.\n",

You must complete the 'find_unique_emails' function below such that it receives a path name (i.e. '../Data/Emails/' ) and **returns the number of unique email addresses** found as an integer variable 'number_unique_emails'.
